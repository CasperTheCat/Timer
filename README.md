# Timer
I made a timer...

# Commands
init [duration] [repeat]  --Creates a new timer
exit                      --Exits the program and deletes all timers

Examples
---
init 15 true    -- Creates a 15 second timer that loops
init 15 false   -- Creates a 15 second timer that doesn't loop
init 15 bob     -- Creates a 15 second timer that doesn't loop
